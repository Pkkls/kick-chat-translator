# Kick Chat Translator

A live chat translator for Kick. Read any stream's chat in your own language, and reply in the channel's.

## What it does

Open a Kick stream where the chat is in a language you don't read. Each message gets its translation right
underneath as it arrives, on live streams and on VOD replays. Type a reply and a preview shows it in the
channel's language above the chat box: press Tab or click it, and that version replaces what you typed.

There is nothing to set up. Incoming chat goes into your browser's language, and what you write goes out in
the language the channel broadcasts in, read from Kick itself. Both can be changed in the settings.

- 43 languages, right-to-left scripts included (Arabic, Hebrew, Persian) and regional variants (Brazilian
  Portuguese, Traditional Chinese, Cantonese)
- Google out of the box, with no key and no account. Your own free DeepL key for better quality, MyMemory
  and Lingva as fallbacks
- On-device translation in Chrome and Edge where the browser offers it: 22 ms instead of 1.6 s, and the text
  never leaves your machine
- 7TV emotes, bot and user filters, a keyword filter, a glossary for names engines mangle
- Chrome, Brave, Edge and Firefox

<sub>Taken from the shipping build in a chat room this repository makes up: the usernames and messages are
invented and the translations are answered locally, so no real person's handle ends up on this page.</sub>

## Install

[Chrome, Brave, Edge: Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kick-chat-translator/nkkjmbkmacbdkboijmnhjnblcaiclhni)
&nbsp;·&nbsp;
[Firefox: Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/kick-chat-translator/)

Open any Kick stream: the green bar at the top of the chat says it is running. Store copies update
themselves.

<details>
<summary>Install by hand, from a release zip</summary>

Download the zip for your browser from [Releases](https://github.com/Pkkls/kick-chat-translator/releases/latest) and unzip it.

- Chrome, Brave, Edge (`…-chromium.zip`): open `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer mode, click Load unpacked, pick the folder.
- Firefox 121+ (`…-firefox.zip`): open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click Load Temporary Add-on, pick `manifest.json`.

A copy installed this way does not update itself. Its icon shows a badge when a newer version exists, and
the popup links to the store.

## Translation engines

Four providers, chained: when one fails, the next takes over. The order is yours to set.

| Provider | Key | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Google | none | the default, works out of the box |
| DeepL | free | the best quality, [free key](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) for 1 million characters a month |
| MyMemory | none | fallback |
| Lingva | none | fallback, on a public instance unless you point it at your own |

Chromium's built-in translator is faster than all of them. Measured on a live channel: 22 ms from a message
appearing to its translation on screen, against 1618 ms through the cloud chain, with no network and no
quota. Chrome and Edge 138 and later can offer it, though not every copy does, and each language pair needs
its model downloaded once, with one click from the bar. Firefox does not have it. Wherever it is missing,
the cloud chain takes over and nothing breaks.

## Settings

Click the gear on the chat bar, or right-click the extension icon and choose Options.

- Target language, and a reading language remembered per channel if you turn it on
- Provider order, your DeepL key, and the engine mode: on-device first, cloud first, or on-device only
- Display: below the message (recommended), inline after it, in place of it, or on hover, with the original
  text and the source language badge optional
- The language button in the chat's action bar: one click switches between the channel's language and your
  last pick, press and hold opens the list, typing two letters filters it
- Compose preview: on or off, its target language, and whether clicking it fills the chat box or copies
- Filters: skip bots, block users, channels or keywords, restrict source languages
- Glossary: find and replace pairs applied to translations
- Budget: DeepL quota share, per-channel rate limit, cache size and lifetime
- Readability and appearance: text size, line spacing, typeface, accent colour, chat theme
- Keyboard: Alt+T turns chat translation on or off, Alt+W the compose preview
- Activity: messages translated, cache hits, every language seen in chat, and why each of the last 50 lines
  was translated or left alone
- The extension's own interface in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Turkish, Russian, Arabic, Chinese,
  Japanese or Korean

## Privacy

No account, no analytics, no server of mine. Chat messages go to the translation provider you picked and
nowhere else, and in on-device mode not even there. A copy installed from a store makes no other request. A
copy installed by hand asks GitHub for the latest release tag, at most every six hours, to know whether to
show its update badge. [Details](PRIVACY.md)

## FAQ

**Messages aren't being translated.**
Open the Activity tab in the settings and press "Read decisions": it lists the last 50 lines and says why
each one was translated or left alone. Most skipped lines are skipped on purpose. Over one live session, 213
of 234 were the same user repeating themselves, 9 were too short, 7 were emoji or laughter only, and 1 was
already in the reading language. If the tab shows nothing at all, the extension is not seeing the chat:
please open an issue.

**The green bar disappeared.**
Refresh the page. If it happens again, open an [issue](https://github.com/Pkkls/kick-chat-translator/issues)
with the channel and what you did before.

**How do I get better translations?**
Add a free DeepL key in the settings. The free tier covers a million characters a month, and DeepL is only
spent on the language pairs where it beats the free engines.

**Which display style should I use?**
Below the message. The other three work, and are still being adjusted.

**Does it work on VOD replays?**
Yes, the same way as on live streams.

**It broke after a Kick update.**
Kick sometimes changes how its chat is built. Open an [issue](https://github.com/Pkkls/kick-chat-translator/issues)
and it gets patched.

**Is this made by Kick?**
No. It is an independent open-source project, not affiliated with Kick.

## What's new

Every release, with what changed and the measurement behind it:
[Releases](https://github.com/Pkkls/kick-chat-translator/releases) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pkkls/kick-chat-translator.git
cd kick-chat-translator
npm ci
npm run release:check    # typecheck, lint, unit tests, build: the gate every package goes through
npm run build:firefox    # Firefox build, same dist/ folder
npm run package:all      # both zips, in release/
npm run dev              # HMR
```

Builds are reproducible: the same commit yields byte-identical zips on any machine, checked by building a
`git archive` of the tag in an empty folder and comparing hashes.

Beyond the unit tests, 39 offline gates load the built extension into a real browser, drive it and assert
what it does, with the page served locally and the translation engine answered locally. They need
Playwright, which is deliberately not a dependency: point `UX_KIT` at a folder whose `node_modules` holds it,
or run `npm i -D playwright`.

```bash
node test/e2e/run-gates.mjs --headless                  # all 39, no window
node test/e2e/store-shots-fixture.mjs --lang=ja         # the store screenshots, in one listing language
node test/e2e/store-shots-fixture.mjs --gif             # English store screenshots, the README images and this GIF
```

Stack: Manifest V3, Vite, TypeScript, Preact, Tailwind. The store texts live in [store/](store/), and a
release is a version tag: CI builds, checks and publishes it to both stores.
