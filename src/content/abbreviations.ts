/**
 * English chat abbreviations, spelled out before an English line goes to the
 * engine for a reader in another language.
 *
 * Google leaves most of these as they are, so the reader gets "ngl c'était
 * propre", or worse, reads them as something else: "idc about the score" came
 * back as "je ne sais pas à propos du score", "lmk when he goes live" as "je
 * verrai quand il sera en direct" and as "kkkkk quando ele entrar ao vivo",
 * "wyd chat" as "charla de la jornada laboral", "irl" as "merde". Spelled out,
 * the same lines come back as what was said. "he is the goat" came back as
 * "c'est lui la chèvre", "el es la cabra", "er ist die Ziege".
 *
 * Measured on 34 chat lines into all 42 other languages, one Google request per
 * language: of 1386 abbreviations, 952 came back exactly as typed. Spelled out,
 * none did.
 *
 * Only abbreviations Google gets wrong are here. `pls`, `btw`, `thx`, `omg`,
 * `bc`, `ppl`, `fyi` and `u` were measured and come back right as they are.
 * `af`, `asf` and `tf` come back WORSE spelled out: "fast asf" became "rapide
 * comme de la merde" where Google alone said "très rapide".
 *
 * The caller spells out only lines the detector reads as English and that carry
 * no letter English does not write. `w` is a preposition in Polish, `l` an
 * article in French and Romanian; measured on 1085 foreign chat lines and 4920
 * Tatoeba lines, that gate rewrites none of them.
