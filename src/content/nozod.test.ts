 * from shared/settings.ts, and that module carries the schema runtime. Measured
 * on this tree when item 102 removed it, content.js went from 81.3 KB to 69.0 KB
 * gzipped, a 15.1% cut, for a validation pass over a blob this extension had just
 * written itself.
 *
 * The regression is silent and one character wide: changing `import type { Settings }`
 * to `import { Settings }` in any file the content script reaches puts all of it
 * back, and every test still passes. So the import graph is walked instead.
