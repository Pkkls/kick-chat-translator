/**
 * The rule these exercise is measured, not asserted: the numbers live in
 * test/e2e/canto-bench.mjs, which reads the two regexes straight out of
 * langDetect.ts so the bench cannot drift from the source. 32 of 35 held-out
 * Cantonese lines, 11 of 12 code-mixed, zero false positives on 40 lines of
 * standard Chinese.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the part a number cannot express: the cases that were
 * decided rather than measured, and the neighbouring behaviour that had to stay
 * exactly as it was.
