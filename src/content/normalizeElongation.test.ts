/**
 * Flattening is a rescue, not a preprocessing step, and these tests pin the reason.
 *
 * Measured against Google on real chat: it already handles some stretching well.
 * "sooo goood" comes back as "tellement bon", and flattening it first produces
 * "alors mon Dieu". So the pipeline only reaches for this after the engine has
 * returned a line unchanged, where there is nothing left to spoil.
 *
 * The other half is what this function must refuse to touch. An isolated Japanese
 * prolongation carries meaning, and an earlier version of this rule stripped it:
 * it turned コーヒー into コヒ, ラーメン into ラメン and スーパー into スパ. Four real
 * words out of four tested, which is why the rule handles repeats only.
