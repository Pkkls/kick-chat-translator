 * The content script's first act on a page is to ask the worker for settings, and

 * message is what wakes it, so the first send after a pause can lose the race.
 *
 * Before this client existed the content script read storage directly, which
 * cannot fail that way. A rejection here aborts main() and the extension does
 * nothing on the page, silently, which is the worst shape a failure can take.
