/**
 * Settings access for the content script, without zod.
 *
 * shared/settings.ts is the only file in the codebase that imports zod, and the
 * content script was the only place that pulled it in for values rather than
 * types. Measured on this tree: zod is 13.7 KB gzipped, 16.8% of content.js, and
 * it was there to re-validate a blob this extension had just written itself.
 *
 * So the content script asks the service worker instead. The worker already owns
 * `settings.get` and `settings.set`, already holds the schema, and already applies
 * the result. Nothing is validated twice and no default is written down twice,
 * which is the failure mode a second local copy of the defaults would have had.
 *
 * The trade is a message round trip at startup, on an extension whose every
 * translation is already a message to that same worker.

/**
 * Current settings, straight from the worker that owns them.
 *
 * Retried, because this is the first thing the content script does on a page and
 * the worker it asks may not exist yet. MV3 kills an idle worker, and a message is
 * what wakes it: the first send after a long pause can lose the race and reject.
 * Reading storage directly could not fail this way, which is what this replaced,
 * so the robustness has to come back somewhere. A retry is that somewhere, and it
 * keeps the defaults in one place instead of shipping a second copy to the page.
 *
 * A rejection here aborts main() and the extension does nothing on the page, in
 * silence. Three attempts over roughly a second is far longer than a wake takes.
