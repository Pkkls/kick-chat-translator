/**
 * Fail the build if instrumentation reached a bundle that ships.
 *
 * shared/metrics.ts selects its sink with `__KT_METRICS__ ? live : NOOP`, a
 * constant vite folds at build time. That is a claim about esbuild's dead-code
 * elimination, and an unverified claim about a privacy boundary is worth nothing:
 * this asserts it against the actual output.
 *
 * Both directions are checked, because a gate that can only pass is not a gate.
 * On a release build the marker must be ABSENT. On `build:metrics` it must be
 * PRESENT, which is the control: if the instrumented build were also clean, the
 * absence in the release build would prove nothing except that the sink is dead
 * everywhere.
 *
 * Run automatically at the end of `npm run build` and `npm run build:metrics`.

 * function invocation and takes its string argument along, so a release used to
 * carry `dom.row.seen` and `compose.skipSameLang.` in plain text. Inert, but it
 * reads to anyone opening the bundle as telemetry that is merely not wired up yet,
 * and a store reviewer opening a bundle is not a hypothetical.
 *
 * Guarding each call site with `__KT_METRICS__` folds the whole statement away.
 * This asserts that none was missed, which no amount of care at the call site can.
